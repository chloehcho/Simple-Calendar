# Plan-it
Uses Simple Calendar's codes.

Just a couple things to set up the app since we couldn't change the source code so in order to match the prototype we had in mind.
After downloading the application go to settings and click on Customize colors then change the Background color to #FFFFFF after change
the Text color to #000000 then change the Primary color to green (10 color from left) it should say #689F38 finally click ok.
Then exit to the main page.

This app is only being used for class and it is not being used for any other purposes.
